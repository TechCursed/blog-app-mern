# Blog-app-mern
This is a Full Stack Blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to register and log in, view their own blog posts as well as those of other users, delete and edit their own blog posts, and provides state management using Redux.

## Technologies Used
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store the blog posts and user information.
* Express: A backend framework used to handle server-side logic and API endpoints.
* React: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used on the server side to build scalable network applications.
* Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, used for managing the application's state.

## Features
* User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their necessary details.
* User Login: Registered users can log in to the application using their credentials.
* Blog Listing: Users can view a list of blog posts from themselves and other users.
* Blog Creation: Users can create new blog posts with a title, content, and other relevant details.
* Blog Editing: Users can edit their own blog posts, updating the title, content, or any other information.
* Blog Deletion: Users can delete their own blog posts from the application.
* State Management: Redux is used to manage the application's state and provide a predictable state container.
